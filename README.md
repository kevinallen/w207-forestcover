# w207-forestcover
###Kaggle competition to predict forest cover type
https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction

**Due Dates**

March 30<br/>Download the data and figure out how to import it into python/numpy objects so you can process it with SKÂ­Learn. Split the data you get into training and development for running your own experiments. Establish a baseline and submit to Kaggle for verification. For your submission, you should probably train your model on all the data you have.

Random numbers scored slightly better than expected!
>Your submission scored 0.14319, which is not an improvement of your best score. Keep trying!

####Feature engineering ideas:
1) Try to smooth features by coming up with a measure of distance or adjacency.<br/>
2) Adjust the vertical distance to hydrology measure by the elevation [reference][link1]
