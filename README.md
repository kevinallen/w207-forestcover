**Due Dates**

March 30<br/>Download the data and figure out how to import it into python/numpy objects so you can process it with SKÂ­Learn. Split the data you get into training and development for running your own experiments. Establish a baseline and submit to Kaggle for verification. For your submission, you should probably train your model on all the data you have.
